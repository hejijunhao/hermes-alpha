## 0.4.0 — Frontend Overhaul

**2026-03-10**

Complete frontend rewrite from a 3-file prototype to a modular, production-grade terminal UI. Deepens the Evangelion retrofuturist aesthetic with layered atmospheric effects, structured message rendering, and a strict design token system — while staying zero-dependency vanilla JS with no build step. See [`completions/001-frontend-overhaul.md`](completions/001-frontend-overhaul.md) for full implementation notes.

### Added

- **Boot sequence** (`js/boot.js`, `css/base.css`) — cinematic startup animation with sequential line reveals ("INITIALIZING NEURAL LINK... OK") before the terminal fades in. Skipped under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Custom model selector** (`js/model-selector.js`, `css/model-selector.css`) — replaces the native `<select>` with a fully styled dropdown panel. Models grouped by provider with size/provider tags, amber accent glow, full keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape), click-outside dismiss.
- **Telemetry strip** (`css/footer.css`) — thin ornamental bar between output and input showing message count, iteration placeholder, and latency placeholder. Animated amber sweep bar during processing state.
- **Status footer** (`js/telemetry.js`, `css/footer.css`) — persistent bar with version string, live clock (updates every second), and connection state indicator: `● READY` (green), `● PROCESSING` (amber, pulsing), `● LINK SEVERED` (red, pulsing).
- **Uptime counter** (`js/telemetry.js`) — `T+HH:MM:SS` in the header center, tracking time since WebSocket connect.
- **Structured messages** (`js/messages.js`, `css/output.css`) — each message now has a gutter (3-digit index + type-colored bar), body, and metadata row (timestamp, model name). Type bars: amber (system), blue (user), red (assistant).
- **Markdown rendering** (`js/messages.js`) — assistant messages rendered with safe markdown: code blocks, inline code, bold, italic, links (http/https only). HTML-escaped first, then regex-transformed — no XSS vectors. User/system messages use `textContent`.
- **Copy to clipboard** (`js/messages.js`, `css/output.css`) — assistant messages show a COPY button on hover. Click copies raw text; button briefly shows "COPIED" in green.
- **Smart auto-scroll** (`js/messages.js`) — detects when user has scrolled up to read history. New messages arrive without forcing scroll; a "NEW MESSAGES ▾" button appears to jump back to bottom.
- **Atmospheric overlays** (`css/base.css`) — three stacking layers: scanlines (5% opacity), SVG fractal noise texture (2.5% opacity), and radial vignette (35% at edges). All `pointer-events: none`, disabled on mobile for performance.
- **Corner accents** (`css/base.css`) — four decorative L-shaped corner marks in `--red-dim` on the terminal frame.
- **Multiline input** — `<textarea>` replaces `<input>`, auto-resizes on typing (up to 6em max). Enter submits, Shift+Enter for newlines. Command counter in left gutter, `[ENTER]` hint on right.
- **Input focus/processing states** (`css/input.css`) — bottom border glows blue on focus, pulses amber during processing.
- **Message transitions** (`css/animations.css`) — new messages fade in with `opacity 0→1` + subtle `translateX(-4px→0)` over 150ms.
- **Responsive breakpoints** (`css/responsive.css`) — 768px (header collapses, centered layout) and 480px (border frame removed, telemetry hidden, CRT effects disabled, larger touch targets).
- **Accessibility** — semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), ARIA roles (`log`, `listbox`, `option`), `aria-live="polite"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label` on all interactive elements, `prefers-reduced-motion` support (all animations disabled, overlays hidden, boot skipped).

### Changed

- **Typography** — switched from system `Courier New`/`Consolas` to IBM Plex Mono (Google Fonts CDN). Strict 5-level type scale from 9px to 16px. All UI chrome uppercase with tracked letter-spacing.
- **Design token system** (`css/tokens.css`) — all visual values extracted into CSS custom properties: 5 background depth layers, 4 accent colors × 3 tiers (full/dim/glow), 3 border tiers, 4px-base spacing scale, transition timing tokens.
- **Header** (`css/header.css`) — redesigned as 3-column CSS grid (logo | status+sync+uptime | model selector). Bottom border glow via gradient pseudo-element; shifts red on disconnect.
- **Processing indicator** — replaced verbose "PROCESSING..." text with minimal `···`, plus multi-indicator feedback across telemetry strip, input bar, and status footer.
- **Connection resilience** (`js/connection.js`) — exponential backoff reconnection (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max), reset on successful connect. Replaces fixed 3-second retry.
- **State management** (`js/terminal.js`) — centralised state object with `getState()`/`setState(patch)` and observer pattern via `subscribe()`. Replaces scattered global variables.
- **Max width** — terminal container widened from 960px to 1080px.
- **Scrollbar** — custom 4px-wide scrollbar with `--blue-dim` thumb on hover.

### Architecture

- **ES modules** — `frontend/main.js` (monolithic, 145 lines) replaced by 7 native ES modules in `frontend/js/` (~800 lines total). Clean dependency graph with no circular imports: `terminal.js` (leaf) → `connection.js`, `messages.js`, `telemetry.js`, `boot.js` → `model-selector.js` → `main.js` (entry).
- **CSS modules** — `frontend/style.css` (228 lines) refactored into 9 CSS files in `frontend/css/` (~450 lines total), imported via a single `style.css` entry point using `@import`.
- **No new dependencies** — remains zero-dep vanilla JS. No build step, no bundler, no framework. IBM Plex Mono loaded via Google Fonts CDN.

### Removed

- **`frontend/main.js`** (root-level) — replaced by `frontend/js/main.js` ES module entry point.
- **Native `<select>` model dropdown** — replaced by custom dropdown component.

## 0.3.1 — Model Dropdown Loading Fix

**2026-03-10**

The model selector dropdown in the terminal header could get stuck on "LOADING..." indefinitely, particularly when the Fly.io machine was waking from auto-stop. The root cause was that the WebSocket connection was chained after the model fetch — if the fetch hung, the entire terminal was unresponsive.

### Fixed

- **Perpetual "LOADING..." dropdown** (`frontend/main.js`) — decoupled `loadModels()` from `connect()` so they run in parallel. The terminal now connects immediately while models load in the background.
- **Fetch timeout** (`frontend/main.js`) — added an 8-second `AbortController` timeout to the `/api/models` fetch. On timeout or error the dropdown shows "UNAVAILABLE" instead of hanging on "LOADING..." forever.
- **Late config sync** (`frontend/main.js`) — if the WebSocket connects before models finish loading, the selected model config is now sent once `loadModels()` completes, ensuring the server always knows the active model.

### Changed

- **`frontend/main.js`** — empty provider responses now show "NO MODELS" instead of leaving the dropdown blank.

---

## 0.3.0 — Dynamic Model Switching & Nous Direct API

**2026-03-10**

Added a model selector dropdown to the terminal header so the active LLM can be switched on-the-fly without redeploying. Also added support for the Nous Research inference API as a direct provider alongside OpenRouter, reducing latency by skipping the OpenRouter proxy layer.

### Added

- **Model selector UI** (`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/style.css`) — `<select>` dropdown in the header bar, styled to match the Evangelion aesthetic. Models are grouped by provider using `<optgroup>`.
- **`GET /api/models`** (`server/main.py`) — REST endpoint that returns available providers and their models. Only providers with a configured API key are included, so the dropdown adapts to the deployment's secrets.
- **WebSocket `config` message** (`server/main.py`, `frontend/main.js`) — new message type `{ type: "config", model, provider }` lets the frontend set the model/provider per session. Switching models resets conversation history and lazily recreates the agent on the next chat message.
- **Nous Research direct inference** — support for `HERMES_API_KEY` (from [portal.nousresearch.com](https://portal.nousresearch.com)) hitting `https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1` directly, bypassing OpenRouter. Available models: Hermes 3 70B, DeepHermes 3 8B.
- **Multi-provider architecture** (`server/main.py`) — `PROVIDERS` dict maps each provider to its `base_url`, API key env var, and model catalogue. Adding a new provider is a single dict entry.

### Changed

- **`server/main.py`** — `_create_agent()` now accepts `model` and `provider_id` parameters, passing the appropriate `base_url` and `api_key` to `AIAgent`. Agent creation is deferred until the first chat message (lazy init).
- **`frontend/main.js`** — `loadModels()` fetches `/api/models` on page load and populates the dropdown. Model selection is sent as a `config` message on change and on each WebSocket reconnect.
- **`.env.example`** — documented `HERMES_API_KEY` for Nous direct inference.

## 0.2.2 — PYTHONPATH Install Strategy

**2026-03-10**

The 0.2.1 `pyproject.toml` patch fixed the missing `agent/` package but exposed a second missing sub-package (`tools/environments/`). Upstream `hermes-agent` also omits `tools.*` sub-packages from its `packages.find.include`, so patching individual entries is a game of whack-a-mole.

### Changed

- **Dockerfile** — replaced the `sed`-patch-then-pip-install approach with a `PYTHONPATH`-based strategy: clone the full `hermes-agent` source to `/opt/hermes-agent`, install only its dependencies via `requirements.txt`, and set `PYTHONPATH` so Python resolves all imports directly from the source tree. This sidesteps all upstream packaging omissions at once.

### Fixed

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tools.environments'`** — `tools/terminal_tool.py` imports `tools.environments.singularity`, a sub-package not included in the upstream package build.

---

## 0.2.1 — Fly.io Deployment Fix

**2026-03-10**

Fixed deployment to Fly.io under the `crimson-sun-technologies` org. The app crashed on first connect due to a missing `agent` module in the upstream `hermes-agent` package.

### Changed

- **`fly.toml`** — switched primary region from `ams` to `sin` (Singapore).
- **Dockerfile** — clones `hermes-agent` from source and patches `pyproject.toml` to include the missing `agent/` package before installing. Upstream omits it from `packages.find`.
- **`server/requirements.txt`** — removed `hermes-agent` (now installed via Dockerfile clone step); dropped `[all]` extras that pulled unnecessary dependencies and caused build timeouts.

### Fixed

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agent'`** — the upstream `hermes-agent` `pyproject.toml` doesn't list the `agent/` directory in its package includes, so `tools/web_tools.py` fails to import `agent.auxiliary_client` at runtime.

---

## 0.2.0 — Hermes Agent Integration

**2026-03-09**

Replaced the echo stub with a live Hermes agent session. See [`0.2.0-agent-integration.md`](0.2.0-agent-integration.md) for full implementation notes.

### Added

- **Hermes agent integration** (`server/main.py`) — each WebSocket connection gets its own `AIAgent` instance with multi-turn conversation support via `run_conversation()`.
- **Environment loading** — `python-dotenv` reads `.env` at startup; `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is now actually consumed.
- **Processing indicator** (`frontend/main.js`, `frontend/style.css`) — pulsing "PROCESSING..." message while the agent thinks, input disabled during this state.
- **Configurable model** — `LLM_MODEL` and `HERMES_MAX_ITERATIONS` env vars control agent behavior.

### Changed

- **Dockerfile** — installs `git` for pip to clone `hermes-agent` from GitHub.
- **`server/requirements.txt`** — added `python-dotenv` and `hermes-agent[all]`.
- **`.env.example`** — added Hermes-specific config options.

### Security

- Terminal/shell toolset disabled (`disabled_toolsets=["terminal"]`) to prevent the agent from running arbitrary commands on the server.

---

## 0.1.0 — Project Scaffolding

**2026-03-09**

Initial project scaffold for self-hosting the [Hermes agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) on Fly.io with an Evangelion-inspired terminal web UI.

### Added

- **FastAPI server** (`server/main.py`) — serves the frontend and exposes a WebSocket endpoint at `/ws` for real-time agent communication. Currently echoes input back as a stub.
- **Terminal UI** (`frontend/`) — single-page vanilla HTML/CSS/JS interface with:
  - Scanline overlay, neon red/blue/green palette, dark panel backgrounds
  - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect
  - Status indicator, sync ratio display, message history
- **Dockerfile** — Python 3.11-slim container serving the full app via uvicorn on port 8080.
- **fly.toml** — Fly.io deployment config targeting Amsterdam (`ams`), with auto-stop/start for cost efficiency.
- **docker-compose.yml** — local dev environment with hot-reload volume mounts.
- **Makefile** — shortcuts for `dev`, `up`, `down`, `deploy`, `logs`, `ssh`, `status`.
- **`.env.example`** — template for required API keys (OpenRouter, etc.).
- **`.gitignore` / `.dockerignore`** — standard exclusions for Python, Docker, IDE files.

### Architecture Decision

Chose **FastAPI + vanilla frontend** over Vue/Vite + Node for simplicity: one process, one port, no build step, no `node_modules`. The UI is a terminal emulator — a single WebSocket connection and ~200 lines of JS. Frameworks can be introduced later if complexity warrants it.
